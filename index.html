    I'm from San Diego and went to Torrey Pines High School. My dog is named Oreo although we call him Snug-A-Lug
    and he is a corgi-dashund mix. I've been doing art since about 3rd grade and like to experiment with all
    mediums instead of sticking to just one. <br>
    I dress alternatively with my brightly colored mohawk, several peircings, and black clothes with chains and
    spikes on them. My favorite genre of music is J-pop/rock/metal. I read a lot of graphic novels and currently
    have about 600 physical books in my collection.
